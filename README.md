# Introduction

**SDFocus (树德 Focus)** is a campus forum mobile application for Chengdu Shude High School (成都树德中学) Students!
 We pursue five concepts: 
- Design. We adopt Google's latest design style "Material Design", from the entire application framework to the smallest button, we bring you a visual feast everywhere.
- Independent. We insist on the principle of independent development, not using any template, not asking others for help, every detail is the result of our team's wisdom.
- Innovative. We are committed to the concept of innovation, such as "metal activity" to represent the level of activity, all innovation only for your better experience.
